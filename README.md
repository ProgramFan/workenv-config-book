# How Do I Create My Working Environment

Almost everyone has his/her own way of configuring the working environment. I am not an exception. However, this is a painful task which requires a lot of search and research. You don't simply download some scripts and then get it done. In my case, I have to deal with 2 laptops, 1 workstation and several cluster systems.
