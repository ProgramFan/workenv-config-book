# Editors

The first and foremost ingredient of any working environment is editors. Here by editors I means tools to edit files. People have different preferences and different groups of preferences often argue with their choices. Some people prefer IDEs, while other people likes text editors. Some people are GUI oriented [This has nothing to do with IDEs, though.]

For me, editors are simple editors.
